#### I was supposed to depict the architecture of VGG16 to use in our article. 
After a series of researches on the Internet, I found some codes and solutions in which my concern had been addressed 
by utilizing a Keras utility called visualkeras. I adopted it and customized it to fit in our transfer learning approach. 
Here, I have provided it for you. I hope it would be useful.
